REPORT:
Patient name: Mr. Thomas Reilly
Age: 58
-------------------------------------
Diagnoses:
- Ischemic heart disease (post triple bypass in 2019)
- Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ~35%)
- Chronic hypertension
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled
- Chronic kidney disease, stage 3b
- Albuminuria (UACR 320)
- Persistent mild hyperkalemia (~5.8)
- Depression
- Medication nonadherence/passive noncompliance
-------------------------------------
Past treatments:
- Metformin (discontinued, GI intolerance)
- Insulin glargine (35 units nightly, inconsistent use)
- Sertraline 50 mg daily (irregular use)
- Beta-blocker (unspecified)
-------------------------------------
Current discussion:
Clinical deterioration noted over past three months. Symptoms include worsening fatigue and lower extremity edema. Lab findings: NT-proBNP elevated (4200), worsening kidney function (eGFR drop from 48 to 36 in six months), increased UACR, persistent hyperkalemia, poor diabetes control (HbA1c 9.1%), and worsening depression with passive noncompliance.
-------------------------------------
Recommendations:
- Switch beta-blocker to carvedilol for better heart failure management.
- Start dapagliflozin 10 mg daily for heart failure and renal protection, with close potassium monitoring.
- Switch to a fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide for diabetes control with cardiovascular and renal benefits.
- Start patiromer 8.4 grams once daily for hyperkalemia.
- Consider long-acting injectable antipsychotic (aripiprazole) for depression if oral medication adherence remains poor.
- Consider increasing sertraline to 100 mg daily if tolerated.
- Initiate social work consult and home health referral for psychosocial support and assistance with care.
- Simplify and coordinate medications, possibly using a blister pack system to improve adherence.
-------------------------------------
Prescriptions:
- Carvedilol (dose to be determined)
- Dapagliflozin 10 mg daily
- Insulin degludec/liraglutide fixed-ratio combination (dose to be determined)
- Patiromer 8.4 g daily
- Sertraline (consider dose increase to 100 mg)
- Aripiprazole LAI (if needed, dose to be determined)
