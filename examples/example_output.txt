REPORT:
Patient name: Thomas Reilly
Age: 58
-------------------------------------
Diagnoses:
- Ischemic heart disease (post triple bypass, 2019)
- Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ~35%)
- Chronic hypertension
- Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 9.1%)
- Chronic kidney disease stage 3b (eGFR 36, albuminuria)
- Hyperkalemia (K+ ~5.8)
- Depression
- Polypharmacy
- Passive noncompliance with medication
-------------------------------------
Past treatments:
- Triple bypass surgery (2019)
- Metformin (discontinued due to GI side effects)
- Insulin glargine, 35 units nightly (inconsistent use)
- Sertraline 50 mg daily (noncompliant)
- Beta-blocker (unspecified, not carvedilol)
- RAAS inhibitor (likely ACEi/ARB, implied)
-------------------------------------
Current discussion:
Mr. Reilly is presenting with clinical deterioration characterized by worsening heart failure symptoms, declining renal function, persistent hyperkalemia, poorly controlled diabetes, and depressive symptoms. There is also evidence of poor medication adherence and social isolation following bereavement.
-------------------------------------
Recommendations:
- Switch current beta-blocker to carvedilol (better for heart failure)
- Initiate dapagliflozin 10 mg daily (monitor potassium)
- Switch to fixed-ratio insulin degludec/liraglutide combination for diabetes control
- Start patiromer 8.4 g/d for hyperkalemia
- Increase sertraline to 100 mg if tolerated, or consider a long-acting injectable antipsychotic (aripiprazole) for depression and adherence issues
- Involve social work and home health services
- Simplify medication regimen and pharmacy coordination (blister pack system)
-------------------------------------
Prescriptions:
- Carvedilol (dose unspecified)
- Dapagliflozin 10 mg daily
- Fixed-ratio insulin degludec/liraglutide (dose TBD)
- Patiromer 8.4 grams once daily
- Sertraline 100 mg daily (if tolerated) OR long-acting injectable aripiprazole (dose TBD)
